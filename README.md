# Deno To-Do List App

This is project created on deno which is a to-do application only using Deno and its libraries.

## Project Intro

Inside this project we are using Deno modules like

* [Oak](https://deno.land/x/oak)
* [Mongo](https://deno.land/x/mongo)
* [View Engine](https://deno.land/x/view_engine)

## Command To Run The Project
```

deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-plugin --unstable app.ts

```

* Note - Unstable tag is used because the Mongo module is still in developing phase by the time when this code has been created.
